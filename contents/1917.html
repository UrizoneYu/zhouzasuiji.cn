									<h3>What western marketers can learn from china?</h3>
									<p>
										<p>
											1)The difference between China and western's market
										</p>
										<p>
											1. Channel-straddling media giants. Western markets have been trained to use highly fragmented, channel-centric strategies to reach consumers. They blind western compaies to the opportunities that when data is aggregated within a single, channel-straddling company.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. A world of closed-loop data. In west, information is not easily connected  across different channles at the consumer level.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. A mobile-first market development. In the west, media developed sequentially over the past century, with radio giving way to TV, followed by the PC and mobile. Im China, the evolution happened much more rapidly , from PC to mobile.
										</p>
										<p>
											Western, marketers have had multiole open channels through which to reach consumers: TV, mail, email, magazines, radio, newspapers, web, and so forth. 
										</p>
										<p>
											In contrast, China's mobile-centric platform has enabled marketers to focus on content-based experiences that will connect with consumers and change behavior quickly.
										</p>
										<p>
											4. A focus on speed. In china, firms in  fast-growing  economy need to show momentum to keep investors on in a race to determine which two or three will be left standing, and if it's clear that a company will not be, funding dries up.
										</p>
										<p>
											A campaign need not be perfect as long as it makes clear progress toward driving awareness and traffic.
										</p>
										<p>
											Large western firms emphasizing scale and efficiency (a profit mindset) while Chinese marketers focus on speed and growth (a revenue mindest). 
										</p>
										<p>
											2)How western companies must change.
										</p>
										<p>
											1. Build closer and deeper relationships with BATs.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. Adopt a mobile-first mindset. Many western marketers think of mobile as simply a smaller version of television. It is not. It's an entirely new medium that should become marketers' primary focus.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. Go all-in on a social, viral approach. KOLs are seen as critical to this approach.
										</p>
										<p>
											4. Move from promotions to content-based engagement. To make consumers want to watch and share, driving engagement ans influencing behavior.
										</p>
										<p>
											5. Shift from channel management to cross-platfrom integration. Firm should be working with the chinese conglomerates to co-create, test, develop, and learn.
										</p>
										<p>
											6. Question the value of planning versus speed. Process innovation, which drives speed, is as valuable as product innovarion.
										</p>
										<p>
											China's compaies can tolerate relatively low profitability in order to scale up quickly. It gives Chinses companies an advantage because they are willing to make big investments and take short-term losses to achieve long-term domaince.
										</p>

								<div>
									<h3>Your workforce is more adaptable than you think</h3>
									<p>
										<p>
											Executives were pessimistic about employees' ability to acquire the capabilities needed to thrive in an era of rapid change, but employees; didn't think so. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Employees were focused on the benefits that from change, and more eager to learn new skills than get the credit from their leaders.
										</p>
										<p>
											How can a company do that? 
										</p>
										<p>
											By creating a learning culture. <br>Engaging employees in transition, not shepherd them. <br>Developing an internal talent pipeline for workforce. 
										</p>
